# Borwell-Software-Challenge
Borwell Software Challenge By Mohammed Belal

This is my attempt at the Borwell Software Challenge to apply for a year's internship position at Borwell. As advised on the website, I have spent 4 hours on this project. I decided to use Java with Maven to complete this project.

Please note that the times in the git commit history may not reflect that as I ran into some issues with getting the JUnit tests to run outside of my IDE. However, I have resolved this by creating this new repository with a Maven-friendly structure, and copying the commits over to this new repository.

<h2>Running the Project</h2>

<h3>To Run</h3>

1. Make sure you have Maven installed
2. Pull the files from the repository OR copy the files manually to your machine
3. Using your machines terminal program, `cd` to the location you have stored all the files in
4. Run `mvn compile`
5. Run `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.mycompany.app.PaintCalc` to run the program. 

<h3>To Test</h3>

1. `cd` to the root folder
2. Run `mvn test`

<h2>How I Developed this Project</h2>

I used a test driven development (TDD) approach when creating this project. I wrote some initial tests and wrote the program to eventually pass these tests. I also added more tests as needed, when I felt like it is reasonable to add more features to the application. 

My plan was to create a simple version of the paint calculator first; one that assumes the room is a rectangular prism of some size. This assumption makes the calculations easier and removes edge cases. Then I planned to expand the programs functionality to be able to handle rooms of different shapes. Unfortunately, due to the time restriction iset myself, I did not get to this part. If I had more time to complete this project I would work to add in these features.

Please feel free to have a look at the commit history for both the main class and the test class to get an insight into the development process I executed.

<h2>Why Borwell?</h2>

I would very much value the opportunity to intern at Borwell as the role provides many opportunities for self development and improving my own skills. A few weeks ago I had attended a careers event where I met the CEO, Steve. Steve explained the opportinities available at Borwell, such as being trained up in new technologies, based on client demand , and then using those new skills straight away for clients. Steve explained that Borwell is always striving to stay on top of the latest technologies and methods, this attracts me as I am always looking to develop myself and provide value.

Steve also explained the welcoming company culture, and the benefits of a small tech business. These inlcude a close knit work circle where everyone is familiar with each other, and the flexibility of the work we can do in such a setting. I also met Tom who did an excellent job of explaining the role and company to me. 

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
